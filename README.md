### Madrid City Location Intelligence
#### UC3M MSc Thesis Project
The typical Huff Gravity Model uses a combination of distance traveled and measures of attractiveness to predict the customer throughput to a particular retail location. In this project we extend the Huff Model by using geolocalized Twitter data to develop a model with actual observations of consumer retail choices. With 2,553,098 geotagged tweets from 24,471 unique users in Madrid, we use a combination of Linear Regression Modeling and Random Forests to find the best model to predict where a consumer decides to shop based on distance from their home, population, similar stores in their neighborhood, and other competing stores along the route. We use El Corte Inglés Department Stores in Madrid as a case study and fit a [model](https://katbot99.shinyapps.io/cortevis/) with R$^2$ of 0.883 and Mean Average Percentage Error of 45.00.
